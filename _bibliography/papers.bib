  abstract={Glioblastoma, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype (GBM), is the most malignant brain tumor in adults, with limited therapeutic intervention. Previous studies have identified a few prognostic markers for GBM, including the methylation status of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter, TERT promoter mutation, EGFR amplification, and CDKN2A/2B deletion. However, the classification of GBM remains incomplete, necessitating a comprehensive analysis. In this study, we investigated the impact of p16INK4A expression in GBM and found that p16INK4A-high GBM exhibits distinct characteristics compared to p16INK4A-low GBM. Specifically, tumor cells with p16INK4A-high expression display a senescent phenotype and are correlated with higher intra-tumoral immune cell infiltration. Furthermore, an association was observed between elevated p16INK4A expression in GBM and extended overall survival of patients. Our in vivo and in vitro studies revealed that CCL13 is predominantly expressed by p16INK4A-high GBM cells. The released CCL13 enhances the infiltration of T cells within the tumor, potentially contributing to the improved prognosis observed in patients with high p16INK4A expression. These findings suggest that tumor cells with a senescence phenotype in GBM, through the secretion of chemokines such as CCL13, may augment immune cell infiltration and potentially enhance patient outcomes by creating a more immunologically active tumor microenvironment.},

  abstract={Cellular senescence, recognized as a key hallmark of aging, leads to the accumulation of senescent cells in various tissues over time. While the detrimental effects of these cells on age-related pathological conditions are well-documented, there is still limited information about how senescent cells are distributed in normal tissues of both young and aged organs. Our research indicates that fully senescent p16INK4A+ cells are rarely identified in the parenchyma of organic tissues and in the stromal cells crucial for structural maintenance, such as fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. Instead, p16INK4A+ cells are more commonly found in immune cells, whether they reside in the organ or are infiltrating. Notably, p16INK4A+ senescent T cells have been observed to induce apoptosis and inflammation in colonic epithelial cells through Granzyme A-PARs signaling, compromising the integrity of the epithelial lining. This study showed that the senescence of immune cells could affect the phenotypical change of the parenchymal cells in the elderly and suggests that targeting immunosenescence might be a strategy to control functional decline in this population.},

Recent research indicates that acid reflux may disrupt the homeostasis of the middle and inner ear through the Eustachian tube. Given this context, we hypothesized that an association between GERD and tinnitus may exist due to the imbalance of the middle and inner ear caused by acid reflux. To explore this connection, we conducted a retrospective cohort study involving 669,159 patients registered in the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (2012–2019) in South Korea. Our data showed that GERD and tinnitus are highly associated. Nevertheless, the use of proton pump inhibitor medication in GERD patients did not show a significant decrease in the onset of tinnitus.},

  abstract = {PARP inhibitors (PARPi) show selective efficacy in tumors with homologous recombination repair (HRR)-defects but the activation mechanism of HRR pathway in PARPi-treated cells remains enigmatic. To unveil it, we searched for the mediator bridging PARP1 to ATM pathways by screening 211 human ubiquitin-related proteins. We discovered TRIM44 as a crucial mediator that recruits the MRN complex to damaged chromatin, independent of PARP1 activity. TRIM44 binds PARP1 and regulates the ubiquitination-PARylation balance of PARP1, which facilitates timely recruitment of the MRN complex for DSB repair. Upon exposure to PARPi, TRIM44 shifts its binding from PARP1 to the MRN complex via its ZnF UBP domain. Knockdown of TRIM44 in cells significantly enhances the sensitivity to olaparib and overcomes the resistance to olaparib induced by 53BP1 deficiency. These observations emphasize the central role of TRIM44 in tethering PARP1 to the ATM-mediated repair pathway. Suppression of TRIM44 may enhance PARPi effectiveness and broaden their use even to HR-proficient tumors.},

abstract={In this study, we explore the dynamic process of colorectal cancer progression, emphasizing the evolution toward a more metastatic phenotype. The term “evolution” as used in this study specifically denotes the phenotypic transition toward a higher metastatic potency from well-formed glandular structures to collective invasion, ultimately resulting in the development of cancer cell buddings at the invasive front. Our findings highlight the spatial correlation of this evolution with tumor cell senescence, revealing distinct types of senescent tumor cells (types I and II) that play different roles in the overall cancer progression. Type I senescent tumor cells (p16INK4A+/CXCL12+/LAMC2−/ MMP7−) are identified in the collective invasion region, whereas type II senescent tumor cells (p16INK4A+/CXCL12+/LAMC2+/MMP7+), representing the final evolved form, are prominently located in the partial-EMT region. Importantly, type II senescent tumor cells associate with local invasion and lymph node metastasis in colorectal cancer, potentially affecting patient prognosis.},

  abstract={The biological process of aging is thought to result in part from accumulation of senescent cells in organs. However, the present study identified a subset of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells which are the major constituents of organ stroma neither proliferative nor senescent in tissues of the elderly, which we termed “mid-old status” cells. Upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes (IL1B and SAA1) and downregulation of anti-inflammatory genes (SLIT2 and CXCL12) were detected in mid-old cells. In the stroma, SAA1 promotes development of the inflammatory microenvironment via upregulation of MMP9, which decreases the stability of epithelial cells present on the basement membrane, decreasing epithelial cell function. Remarkably, the microenvironmental change and the functional decline of mid-old cells could be reversed by a young cell-originated protein, SLIT2. Our data identify functional reversion of mid-old cells as a potential method to prevent or ameliorate aspects of aging-related tissue dysfunction.},

  abstract={Senescent tumor cells are nonproliferating tumor cells which are closely related to cancer progression by secreting senescence-related molecules, called senescence-associated secreting phenotypes. Therefore, the presence of senescent tumor cells is considered a prognostic factor in various cancer types. Although senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining is considered the best marker for detection of senescent tumor cells, it can only be performed in fresh-frozen tissues. p16INK4A, a cyclin-dependent inhibitor, has been used as an alternative marker to detect senescent tumor cells in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. However, other reliable markers to detect senescent tumor cells is still lacking. In the present study, using public singlecell RNA-sequencing data, we found that p15INK4B, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, is a novel marker for detection of senescent tumor cells. Moreover, p15INK4B expression was positively correlated with that of p16INK4A in colorectal cancer tissues. In in vitro studies, mRNA expression of p15INK4B was increased together with that of p16INK4A in H2O2- and therapy-induced cancer senescence models. However, the mRNA level of p15INK4B did not increase in the oncogeneinduced senescence model in primary colonic epithelial cells. In conclusion, p15INK4B is a potential alternative marker for detection of senescent tumor cells together with conventional markers in advanced stages of colorectal cancer. },

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between visceral fat surrounding the heart and the lipid core burden in patients with coronary artery diseases; (2) Methods: Overall, 331 patients undergoing coronary angiography with combined near-infrared spectroscopy and intravascular ultrasound imaging were evaluated for epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) thickness using transthoracic echocardiography. Patients were divided into thick EAT and thin EAT groups according to the median value; (3) Results: There was a positive correlation between EAT thickness and maxLCBI4mm, and maxLCBI4mm was significantly higher in the thick EAT group compared to the thin EAT group (437 vs. 293, p < 0.001). EAT thickness was an independent predictor of maxLCBI4mm ≥ 400 along with age, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level, acute coronary syndrome presentation, and plaque burden in a multiple linear regression model. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that EAT thickness was a predictor for maxLCBI4mm ≥ 400; (4) Conclusions: In the present study, EAT thickness is related to the lipid core burden assessed by NIRS-IVUS in patients with CAD which suggests that EAT may affect the stability of the plaques in coronary arteries.},

  journal={Experimental & Molecular Medicine},
  abstract={Senescent cells in cancer tissue, including senescent fibroblasts and macrophages, have been reported to increase the malignant potency of cancer cells by secreting senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Otherwise, Senescence of tumor cells has been believed to inhibit tumor growth by halting the massive proliferation and increasing the chances of immune clearance. In particular, senescent tumor cells (STCs) have been thought that they rarely exist in carcinomas because oncogene-induced senescence needs to be overcome for protumorigenic cells to become malignant. However, recent studies have revealed that a considerable number of STCs are present in cancer tissue, even in metastatic sites. In fact, STCs are widely involved in cancer progression by leading to collective invasion and building a cytokine barrier to protect nonsenescent tumor cells from immune attack. Furthermore, therapy-induced STCs can induce tumor progression and recurrence by increasing stemness. However, obscure causative factors and their heterogeneity in various cancers make it difficult to establish the physiological role of STCs. Here, we summarize and review the current knowledge of the pathophysiology and role of STCs. We also outline the current status of therapeutic strategies for directly removing STCs or modulating the SASPs to maximize the positive functions of STCs while suppressing the negative functions.},

  abstract={Cellular senescence can either support or inhibit cancer progression. Here, it is shown that intratumoral infiltration of CD8+ T cells is negatively associated with the proportion of senescent tumor cells in colorectal cancer (CRC). Gene expression analysis reveals increased expression of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) and colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) in senescent tumor cells. Senescent tumor cells inhibit CD8+ T cell infiltration by secreting a high concentration of CXCL12, which induces a loss of CXCR4 in T cells that result in impaired directional migration. CSF1 from senescent tumor cells enhance monocyte differentiation into M2 macrophages, which inhibit CD8+ T cell activation. Neutralization of CXCL12/CSF1 increases the effect of anti-PD1 antibody in allograft tumors. Furthermore, inhibition of CXCL12 from senescent tumor cells enhances T cell infiltration and results in reducing the number and size of tumors in azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced CRC. These findings suggest senescent tumor cells generate a cytokine barrier protecting nonsenescent tumor cells from immune attack and provide a new target for overcoming the immunotherapy resistance of CRC.},
